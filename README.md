# react-app-template
React template that includes linting and code formatting support, a bundler, testing dependencies, and my own opinionated project structure.

## Getting Started
Using this template is simple once you know your way around a React.js application.

### Structure
All code relevant files are in the `./codebase` directory by default, this is, in my opinion, a great way to separate config (`.vscode`, `.github`, `README.md`, etc) and code files.

### Technology Defaults
* Bundler: Parcel.js
* Package Manager: yarn
* Linter: ESLint
* Formatter: Prettier
* Unit Testing: jest

### Quick Start
The following commands will get you up and running, ready to make changes to your new React application:

```
cd codebase
yarn install
yarn start
```

You'll be installing project dependencies using yarn, and running a simple script found in the `./codebase/package.json` file to start the Parcel bundler in `watch` mode, repackaging the app as source files are updated.
